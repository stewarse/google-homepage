This is my first project with TOP. I am going to be building a replica of the Google homepage to develop my HTML and CSS knokwledge. By the end of this, project I will have demonstrated my ability to create a web page with HTML and how to apply styles to that page. When I'm done with this I should have a page that mimics the look and feel, as well as my ability to analyze a web page using the dev tools to identify styling and to apply them to my site.
